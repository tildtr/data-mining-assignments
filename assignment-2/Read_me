I just try to to the mining with a random sample of the dataset since the entire dataset are 3214874 transactions. I did a subset sampling with 600000 which was the maximum that i could without crashing my pc.
The same with the threshold i only coul go as low as 0.01 lower than that crashes my pc. If you guys want to test with a bigger sampling size or even try with the full dataset on your macÂ´s.
Guys you need to have the file pyfim where it is defined the function for the eclat algorithm
